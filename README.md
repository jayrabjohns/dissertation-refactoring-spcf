# Refactoring SPCF

## Building locally with GHC and Cabal.
Firstly, you'll need GHC and Cabal, which can be installed with [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/install/).

```shell
cabal run
```

Worth noting that the bounded SPCF contains n natural numbers in its definition directly -> no need for church representation.


STLC impl has pass by name semantics -> application does not evaluate the rhs beforehand?


It seems that the runtime tpye information is only needed for the counting of reduction steps. This makes sense since it requires a sense for how many more reductions will be necessary at any given time during the evaluation.


The evaluation itself doesn't need the type information. This is analogous to running an executeable, type information is lost.

But for the refactoring step type information will most likely be needed. I suppose it's a nice intersection between run time computation being performed at program time.Â¬
