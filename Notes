different evaluation strateies

analysis of runtime overheads and any potential decisions of stack vs heap allocation

monadic implementation -> comparison

garbage collection? unbounded programs will need some sort of memory management,
perhaps delete as necessary at EOL, once evaluation of a term finishes. By definition, variables in an affine program will have at most one reference so this should be safe.

storing type infromation at runtime? might not be necessary.
